# Beatsaber_Score_Saver

## This is a project maintained by Nergy101 and PtRanger
## Trello board: https://trello.com/b/8TRLBJYr/scoresaver

### This Project exists of a few parts, mainly:

#### The Table & Sorter - Sort all your local scores to see who's the best!
Also there's a Score Combiner when you have multiple local-score files to sort (when there's more than 1 VR in the room).

#### The Score Restorer - Makes it easy to save your local Scores
By doing this you won't ever loose your precious local scores anymore because of updates and such!
